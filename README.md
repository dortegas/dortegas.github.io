# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview
A microbiology laboratory has a biological research project where the goal is to discover and document bacterial species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef. The laboratory has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food project to research candidate species where a microorganism can supply the best taste.

Roza, a laboratory researcher, believes this microorganism can be found from bacteria on the human belly button to make synthetic beef. Roza has sampled the navels of volunteers to identify bacterial species that colonize a belly button. Each personâ€™s identity is anonymous, so they have been assigned an ID number.

On this dashboard the dropdown menu lists the ID numbers of all the volunteers. When a volunteer ID is chosen, that person's demographics information, such as location, sex, and age, will be displayed, the bar and bubble charts display information about the bacterial species live in their navel.
